:::

## How Do I Access the dashboard?
 - Its simple! Navigate to [https://discortics.ga](https://discortics.ga)
 - Click on `LOGIN` or `DASHBOARD` in the top-bar. 
 - You will be redirected to Discords Authorisation Page. Click `Authorize`.
 In a few seconds, you'll be able to select your servers and proceed further.

## Why does it say ERROR 403: Authorisation Required?
By default, most of the browsers disable `cross-site`/`third-party` cookies. Unfortunately, we rely on them (won't be an issue once we hire a developer to rewrite the dashboard in React.js).<br>
